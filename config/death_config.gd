## Every number that decides what dying costs.

## SPEC.md: the lethality is the good part and the punishment was the bad part.
## These are the numbers that decide whether dying twenty times in a row is
## annoying (fine) or tedious (a failed milestone), so they live here and no
## script sets one.

## the screen glitching, and it is the first number to cut if the loop feels
## slow.
